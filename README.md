# Polygon on Map

This project is a web application that allows users to interact with a map, create polygons by clicking on points, and export the polygons as GeoJSON. It is built using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for map rendering and interaction.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Click on the map to add points.
- **Dynamic Polygon Creation**: Automatically creates a polygon when at least three points are added.
- **Export GeoJSON**: Export the created polygon as a GeoJSON file.
- **Clear Map**: Clear all points and polygons from the map.
- **Dynamic Circle Radius**: Circle radius adjusts dynamically based on the zoom level.
- **Coordinate Display**: View the coordinates of the mouse pointer in real-time.
